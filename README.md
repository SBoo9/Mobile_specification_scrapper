# Mobile_specification_scrapper
Mobile data scrapper from web using Scrapy Beautiful Soup and Requests
Firstly I extracted current generration top mobile names as well as their links from "https://www.91mobiles.com/" using Requests and Beautiful Soup and collected them into a csv file.
Then I used Scrapy to go through each link and extract the data for each mobile's price, rating and specifications. 
Before using the specification csv file you will need to clean it up.
